      <p>Professor in Global Change Ecology affiliated with the <a href="https://w4.uib.no/en/research/research-groups/terrestrial-ecology">Terrestrial Ecology</a> research group within the Department of Biological Sciences and the Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research at the University of Bergen. Professor Ørjan Totland's <strong>research interests</strong> include:</p>
      
      <ul class="mb-0">
        <li>Relationship between insect pollination and plant-flower evolution, for its reproductive success in mountain ecosystems and for agricultural production.</li>
        <li>Understand the effects of climate change to plant-pollinator interactions, as for the dynamics of plant populations and communities in alpine ecosystems.</li>
        <li>Remote Sensing applications to identify plant species and to quantify population density in alpine ecosystems.</li>

      <p><strong>Ecological study of Olea European ssp. cuspidata in Hugumbirda regional forest priority area:</strong> investigating its population structure, response to environmental factors, and the influence of human disturbance. The research highlights ontogenetic niche shifts across different life stages (seedlings, saplings, and adults) and the importance of conservation strategies considering these shifts and disturbance levels.</p>

      <p><strong>Building capacity for REDD+ in East Africa for improved ecosystem health and for sustainable livelihoods in Eastern Africa (NORHED):</strong> Contribute to reduced greenhouse gas emissions and improved ecosystem health for sustainable livelihoods in Eastern Africa. For that, NORHED has:</p>
      <ul class="mb-0">
        <li>Developed adequate human capacity for REDD+ in Ugandan and Tanzanian Higher Education Instituted developed.</li>
        <li>Created functional and specialized training programs on REDD+.</li>
        <li>Created research capacity for REDD+ and evidence based results for policy on REDD+.</li>
        <li>Developed networks and partnerships betweenacademic, research institutions and CSOs.</li>

      <p><strong>Effects of climate change on species diversity in alpine reindeer rose communities in Southern Norway:</strong> This research project investigates how climate change, particularly warming temperatures, affects species diversity within alpine reindeer rose (Dryas octopetala) communities in Southern Norway. The study focuses on understanding how changes in temperature, nutrient availability, and other environmental factors influence plant communities, with a specific interest in how these changes impact species interactions and overall ecosystem function.</p>
