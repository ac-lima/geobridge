      <p><strong>Quantitative estimates of Past UV-B irradiance from fossil pollen (QUEST-UV):</strong> Reconstructing changes in UV-B radiation at Earth's surface through the chemical analysis of fossil-pollen grains, using greenhouse and field experiements to quantitatively determine the response of Pinus sylvestris pollen to different wavelengths of light. This understanding will be used to provide the first quantitative reconstruction of UV-B radiation based on sediments representing up to the last 10,000 years.</p>
    </div>

     <div class="members-background-box">
      <p><strong>Modelling Ecological state and Condition Maps to support knowledge-based decision-making in Area management and spatial Planning (ECoMAP):</strong> Data and knowledge must be available in formats and at spatial scales that are relevant to the local decision-makers holding the key to land-use transformation. However, the available ecological data often is spatially scattered and managers struggle to connect it to their local contexts. ECoMAP will counter these challenges by:</p>
      <ul class="mb-0">
        <li>Collaborating with local and regional decision-makers to identify mismatches between available and sought-after information.</li>
        <li>Deriving ecological variables from existing raw ecological data that are of relevance for decision-making processes.</li> 
        <li>Using modelling approaches to fill the gaps in spatial coverage of ecological information.</li>
        <li>Making the ecological information resulting from available data as map-layers in the portal for ecological base maps at the Norwegian Biodiversity Information Centre.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="members-background-box">
      <p><strong>Interglacial and glacials â€“ natural experiments in biodiversity dynamics (IGNEX):</strong> The change from glacial to interglacial conditions form a series of 'natural experiments' and can be used to test ecological hypotheses about what determines long-term community assembly, composition, and structure of vegetation as well as biodiversity dynamics (taxonomic, functional, phylogenetic) and turnover. IGNEX uses numerical methods to detect major recurring patterns of vegetation change, biodiversity, and turnover for selected interglacial and glacial stages based on pollen percentages.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="members-background-box">
      <p><strong>Pollen Chemistry as a Next-Generation Tool in Palaeoecology (POLLCHEM):</strong> Focused on utilizing pollen chemistry as a novel tool in palaeoecology, the project aims to develop new methods for reconstructing past environments and understanding ecological changes by analyzing the chemical composition of pollen grains. This approach offers a potentially powerful way to study past UV-B radiation levels, taxonomic identification, and other ecological parameters. </p>

    <div class="members-background-box">
      <p><strong>No-Analogue Climates and ecological responses in the past and future (NoAClim):</strong> Designed to test the scenario of novel, no-analogue climates and ecosystems in Norden and to bridge the gap between climate and biodiversity research. Norden supports over 3000 native flowering plants and a wide range of ecosystems, some unique to Norden. Ecosystems, like climates, are not static entities. They vary in space and time and palaeoecological studies demonstrate major changes in their distribution, composition, and extent over time, primarily in response to Holocene climate changes at millennial or centennial scales and, in the late Holocene, to changes in land-use, human impact, and soil. Few major terrestrial ecosystems have existed for more than the past 11,000 years, and most are considerably younger, some developing only within the last few centuries. Future ecosystems are inevitably uncertain and historically contingent but the richness of palaeoecological biotic responses seen in the Holocene suggests that many future outcomes are possible.</p>

    <div class="members-background-box">
      <p><strong>Developing a method to measure UV-B flux through time using aromatic compounds contained in fossil pollen and leaf cuticle (PARASOL):</strong> aims to develop a method for reconstructing past UV-B radiation levels by analyzing aromatic compounds in fossil pollen and leaf cuticles. These compounds, produced by plants as a protective mechanism against UV-B, are preserved in the geological record and can be quantified to infer past UV-B exposure. This technique has the potential to provide valuable insights into past climate, ecosystem responses, and even ozone layer fluctuations.</p>
