Hence, looking into the past can provide the empirical foundation for anticipating ecological responses to global warming and perhaps provide evidence for a more optimistic Future.

By combining expertise in ecology, evolutionary biology, and climate science, and using innovative modelling approaches alongside comprehensive plant datasets and their evolutionary trajectories, we aim to uncover the historical processes that drive species diversity in tropical mountain systems.

Through meticulous data compilation and analysis, we aim to shed light on how past humans have shaped terrestrial ecosystems. From studying pollen records and climatic variations to detecting indicators of human presence, our project delves into the intricate interplay of nature and human influence during the Holocene. Subprojects include the Anthropogenic pollen indicators: global food plants and Latin American human indicators in the pollen record, Humans impacts in Amazonia, and Humans on Planet Earth (HOPE). \n    \n\n    \n      Pantropical Dynamics: The Pantropical Dynamics is a collaborative network that unifies researchers interested in ecosystem dynamics across Latin America, Africa, and the Indo-Pacific regions. This intercontinental initiative is committed to unraveling the complexities of vegetation ecosystem dynamics since the Last Glacial Maximum (c. 22 ka) using compilations of fossil pollen records. Our forthcoming publications include continental-scale synthesis of vegetation dynamics of Latin America, Africa, and Indo-Pacific, while we also have individual projects running as part of PhD projects.\n    \n\n    \n      Fossilpol Workflow: The goal of the FOSSILPOL project is to make it easier for the interdisciplinary researcher to work with big fossil pollen databases. We developed a paper, workflow and R-package to process multiple fossil pollen records to create a comprehensive, standardised dataset compilation, ready for multi-record and multi-proxy analyses at various spatial and temporal scales.\n    \n\n    \n      Latin American Pollen Database (LAPD): Latin American Pollen Database project Twitter Website Since 2009 I have been leading the Latin American Pollen Database (LAPD) and I have been part of Neotoma Paleoecology Database and Community.
