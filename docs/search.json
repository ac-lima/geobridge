Dr. Suzette Flantua's research interests include:\n      \n      \n        Integrate biogeography, paleoecology, landscape ecology, and spatial analyses to gain new insights into the drives of global mountain biodiversity over short and long time scales.\n        Responses of biodiversity to past and future climate change and humans, with special emphasis on mountain systems and alpine ecosystems.\n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n      Research Projects\n    \n      \n    \n      Past, Present and Future of Alpine Biomes Worldwide (PPF-Alpine): Elucidating the Quaternary history (last 2.6 million years) of alpine biomes, based on the notion that their dynamic past may hold key insights for their future resilience. Hence, looking into the past can provide the empirical foundation for anticipating ecological responses to global warming and perhaps provide evidence for a more optimistic Future. To decipher the biogeographical history of alpine diversity, PPF-Alpine has two underlying principles:\n      \n        We incorporate cross-disciplinary lines of research into one joint research project integrating expertise, tools, and data from paleoecology, biogeography, macroecology, and landscape modelling. This integration is essential to address one of the most important questions in biogeography, namely‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòWhat causes global patterns of alpine biodiversity?\n        We promote research that acknowledges and quantifies the legacy of long-term dynamics of the past in present-day biodiversity.\n      \n    \n\n     \n      GLACIMONTIS: Understanding the extent of mountain glaciers during past cold periods, with a focus on the Last Glacial Maximum (~21,000 years ago) and the last glacial cycle (the last 130,000 years).

Our project investigates how past climate change and landscape connectivity have shaped the extraordinary biodiversity found here today. By combining expertise in ecology, evolutionary biology, and climate science, and using innovative modelling approaches alongside comprehensive plant datasets and their evolutionary trajectories, we aim to uncover the historical processes that drive species diversity in tropical mountain systems.

Through meticulous data compilation and analysis, we aim to shed light on how past humans have shaped terrestrial ecosystems. From studying pollen records and climatic variations to detecting indicators of human presence, our project delves into the intricate interplay of nature and human influence during the Holocene. Subprojects include the Anthropogenic pollen indicators: global food plants and Latin American human indicators in the pollen record, Humans impacts in Amazonia, and Humans on Planet Earth (HOPE). \n    \n\n    \n      Pantropical Dynamics: The Pantropical Dynamics is a collaborative network that unifies researchers interested in ecosystem dynamics across Latin America, Africa, and the Indo-Pacific regions. This intercontinental initiative is committed to unraveling the complexities of vegetation ecosystem dynamics since the Last Glacial Maximum (c. 22 ka) using compilations of fossil pollen records. Our forthcoming publications include continental-scale synthesis of vegetation dynamics of Latin America, Africa, and Indo-Pacific, while we also have individual projects running as part of PhD projects.\n    \n\n    \n      Fossilpol Workflow: The goal of the FOSSILPOL project is to make it easier for the interdisciplinary researcher to work with big fossil pollen databases. We developed a paper, workflow and R-package to process multiple fossil pollen records to create a comprehensive, standardised dataset compilation, ready for multi-record and multi-proxy analyses at various spatial and temporal scales.\n    \n\n    \n      Latin American Pollen Database (LAPD): Latin American Pollen Database project Twitter Website Since 2009 I have been leading the Latin American Pollen Database (LAPD) and I have been part of Neotoma Paleoecology Database and Community.
