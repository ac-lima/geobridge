Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite data provide high-resolution, frequent observations suitable for monitoring snowline dynamics. Building upon the work of Winsvold et al. (2018) and the Copernicus Glacier Service (Andreassen et al., 2021), this project aims to analyse snowline changes and melt events across Norwegian glaciers.\n        Supervisor: Dr. Benjamin Robson\n      \n      \n      \n        Changes in Surface Characteristics of Glaciers in Jotunheimen\n        Glaciers such as Storbreen, Hellstugubreen, and Gråsubreen in the Jotunheimen region exhibit dynamic surface features, including crevasse patterns and supraglacial drainage channels.

These are very important questions to get answers to since Lisle Lyngøyna is not unique, there are many similar wreck bays along the coast of Norway that are exposed to the same type of plastic accumulation. The project investigates whether plants and insects are directly and indirectly harmed by plastic in soil and water, and whether plastic affects the activity of microorganisms in the soil and the gases they produce.

The project reconstructs glaciers in mountains worldwide with cutting edge techniques and compiles paleoglacier reconstructions from published studies into a global open-access geodatabase, integrating geomorphological mapping, chronological data, and glacier modelling outputs. This resource allows researchers to analyse past ice cover at regional to global scales, refine climate and glacier models, and assess the role of glaciation in shaping mountain environments. Beyond compiling existing data, GLACIMONTIS also develops new reconstructions in poorly studied regions, advancing our understanding of past cryosphere–climate interactions.\n    \n\n    \n      Ecological Spatial Competence and Education (ECO-SPACE): New course for our students at BIO and UiB to address a critical gap in Norway’s higher education: the lack of geospatial training for biology and environmental science students that integrates Universal Design (UD) principles. The course will combine GIS, Remote Sensing, and spatial analysis with ecological and environmental applications, ensuring that students learn to create accessible, inclusive, and impactful geospatial products. Course content will be built from BIO research projects, stakeholder case studies, and collaborations with national and international partners. ECO-SPACE will also serve as a platform for collaboration—through workshops with UiB researchers, stakeholders, and industry—to co-develop high-quality teaching modules and build capacity in UD and geospatial methods.

Such features, found on the debris-covered surface of the glacier, play a crucial role in how the glacier loses mass. Using a mix of historical aerial imagery, satellite data, and drone-based surveys, we aim to build an inventory of supraglacial lakes and ice-cliffs from 1956 to 2023.
