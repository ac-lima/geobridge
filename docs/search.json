However, the available ecological data often is spatially scattered and managers struggle to connect it to their local contexts. ECoMAP will counter these challenges by:\n      \n        Collaborating with local and regional decision-makers to identify mismatches between available and sought-after information.\n        Deriving ecological variables from existing raw ecological data that are of relevance for decision-making processes. \n        Using modelling approaches to fill the gaps in spatial coverage of ecological information.\n        Making the ecological information resulting from available data as map-layers in the portal for ecological base maps at the Norwegian Biodiversity Information Centre.\n      \n    \n\n    \n      Interglacial and glacials ‚Äì natural experiments in biodiversity dynamics (IGNEX): The change from glacial to interglacial conditions form a series of 'natural experiments' and can be used to test ecological hypotheses about what determines long-term community assembly, composition, and structure of vegetation as well as biodiversity dynamics (taxonomic, functional, phylogenetic) and turnover.

Norden supports over 3000 native flowering plants and a wide range of ecosystems, some unique to Norden. Ecosystems, like climates, are not static entities. They vary in space and time and palaeoecological studies demonstrate major changes in their distribution, composition, and extent over time, primarily in response to Holocene climate changes at millennial or centennial scales and, in the late Holocene, to changes in land-use, human impact, and soil. Few major terrestrial ecosystems have existed for more than the past 11,000 years, and most are considerably younger, some developing only within the last few centuries. Future ecosystems are inevitably uncertain and historically contingent but the richness of palaeoecological biotic responses seen in the Holocene suggests that many future outcomes are possible.\n    \n\n    \n      Developing a method to measure UV-B flux through time using aromatic compounds contained in fossil pollen and leaf cuticle (PARASOL): aims to develop a method for reconstructing past UV-B radiation levels by analyzing aromatic compounds in fossil pollen and leaf cuticles. These compounds, produced by plants as a protective mechanism against UV-B, are preserved in the geological record and can be quantified to infer past UV-B exposure. This technique has the potential to provide valuable insights into past climate, ecosystem responses, and even ozone layer fluctuations."

By combining expertise in ecology, evolutionary biology, and climate science, and using innovative modelling approaches alongside comprehensive plant datasets and their evolutionary trajectories, we aim to uncover the historical processes that drive species diversity in tropical mountain systems.

This intercontinental initiative is committed to unraveling the complexities of vegetation ecosystem dynamics since the Last Glacial Maximum (c. 22 ka) using compilations of fossil pollen records. Our forthcoming publications include continental-scale synthesis of vegetation dynamics of Latin America, Africa, and Indo-Pacific, while we also have individual projects running as part of PhD projects.\n    \n\n    \n      Fossilpol Workflow: The goal of the FOSSILPOL project is to make it easier for the interdisciplinary researcher to work with big fossil pollen databases. We developed a paper, workflow and R-package to process multiple fossil pollen records to create a comprehensive, standardised dataset compilation, ready for multi-record and multi-proxy analyses at various spatial and temporal scales.\n    \n\n    \n      Latin American Pollen Database (LAPD): Latin American Pollen Database project Twitter Website Since 2009 I have been leading the Latin American Pollen Database (LAPD) and I have been part of Neotoma Paleoecology Database and Community. I've facilitated the upload of pollen records to Neotoma from Latin America, and also from Europe and the Indo-Pacific region, together with several collaborators associated to the European Pollen Database and Neotoma."
