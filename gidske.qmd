      <p>Associate Professor in GIS, Remote Sensing and Cartography affiliated with the <a href="https://www.uib.no/en/environment">Environment and Landscape Geography</a> research group within the Department of Geography and the Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research at the University of Bergen. Dr. Gidske Andersen's <strong>research interests</strong> include:</p>
      
      <ul class="mb-0">
        <li>Landscape- and environmental change in time and space with the application of GIS and Remote Sensing to understand how these changes are influenced by both social and natural factors.</li>
        <li>Traditional land uses shaping cultural landscapes and its interactions with concurrent environmental and climate effects.</li>

      <p><strong>Norwegian Centre for Hydrogen Value Chain Research (FME-centre HyValue):</strong> Researches the entire hydrogen value chain, including production, distribution, end-user applications, risk assessment, and the societal and economic aspects of hydrogen implementation in a holistic approach, combining technical solutions, economic incentives, regulatory frameworks, and consideration of societal and environmental impacts. HyValue addresses give key challenges:</p>
      <ul class="mb-0">
        <li>Efficient and cost-effective hydrogen and ammonia production.</li>
        <li>Safe and resilient transport and distribution systems.</li>
        <li>Development of end-user applications.</li>
        <li>Stimulating investments and building systems with acceptable risk.</li>
        <li>Building public trust in a hydrogen economy.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>How plastic and plastic clean-up affect the ecosystem on Lisle Lyngøyna:</strong> Investigates the effects of plastic pollution on the ecosystem as a whole, and the effects of plastic removal. These are very important questions to get answers to since Lisle Lyngøyna is not unique, there are many similar wreck bays along the coast of Norway that are exposed to the same type of plastic accumulation. The project investigates whether plants and insects are directly and indirectly harmed by plastic in soil and water, and whether plastic affects the activity of microorganisms in the soil and the gases they produce. Also, the project investigates how plastic contributes to landscape changes by conducting an "archaeological" excavation of plastic soil to find out when the landscape changes started and how plastic has contributed to it.</p>

      <p><strong>Use of active modes of transport in Bergen and Alver municipality:</strong> focuses on promoting active modes of transport like walking and cycling, and integrating them with public transport. This involves strategies like developing mobility hubs, improving walkability, and promoting the use of a recently opened active mobility tunnel. The overall goal is to reduce reliance on cars and promote a more sustainable and healthy transportation system.</p>

      <p><strong>Toxicity effects assessment of plastic litter buried in soil:</strong> Taims to understand the environmental risks associated with plastic pollution in terrestrial environments, specifically focusing on the toxicity of buried plastic waste. It investigates the potential release of toxic substances from plastics into the environment and the resulting effects on soil organisms and ecosystems. The project also seeks to establish criteria for handling buried plastic litter, considering the associated costs and environmental impacts.</p>
